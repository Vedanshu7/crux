"""
Fakes for the two seams the engine talks to.

A fake records what it was asked, because half the value of these tests is
asserting that the engine **batched** — one adjudication call for six decisions,
not six calls. A design whose whole economic argument rests on batching needs a
test that would notice if it stopped.

No global state: build one in the test and pass it in.
