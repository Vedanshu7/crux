"""
The one experiment loop, and the backend protocol it drives.

A platform adds what the harness deliberately lacks: run history, a diff between
two experiments, and per-call traces you can click into. What it must not do is
own the loop. ``run_case`` and ``score_case`` stay the single definition of what
was measured, and a backend receives finished results.

The judge scores a *continuation*: the session is scored exactly as the recall
ratchet scores it (questions left unanswered), then carried to a compiled prompt
with the scripted respondent so the judge has something to read. The scoring
session is never changed by that.
