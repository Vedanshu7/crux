"""
The saturation experiment.

This is the measurement the graph's existence turns on, and the falsification
criteria are written down here *before* it runs so the result cannot be read
generously after the fact.

    uv run python -m tests.evals.saturation --record        # real model
    uv run python -m tests.evals.saturation                 # replay a cassette

Six metrics, and the fifth is the one most likely to be skipped and most likely
to change the conclusion:

1. marginal yield per pass, per stratum
2. k* — the smallest pass index whose yield falls below 10%
3. edge density — how often the expander attaches a conditional edge
4. edge *firing* density — how often one of those ever does anything
5. noise floor — pass one, sampled three times, compared to itself
6. questions and assumptions, with the graph and with it flattened

Without (5), k* is uninterpretable: a "new" decision on pass two may simply be
the model sampling differently, not finding anything deeper.
