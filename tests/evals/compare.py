"""
Comparing two eval runs case by case, not only on the mean.

A prompt that fixes every project-sized case and breaks one one-liner is flat
on the mean and invisible. GEPA (arXiv 2507.19457, Table 3) measured greedy
selection on the mean reaching half the gain of selection over per-instance
bests. So the comparison here says, per score, how many cases each run leads,
and names every case that regressed.
