"""
The eval harness: a corpus, a scorer, and a cassette.

What this measures is **decision recall** — did crux surface the decisions that
matter, and did it stay quiet about the ones it should have resolved itself. It
does not measure whether the wording was nice.

Two deliberate choices worth defending:

- **No LLM judge.** Matching is canonical-id equality, falling back to token
  overlap for freeform decisions. A judge would make the harness itself flaky,
  and a flaky harness is one nobody reruns.
- **Aggregate assertions, never per-case.** Individual cases move for reasons
  that have nothing to do with a regression. The ratchet is on the mean.

The cassette exists because a re-scoring you have to pay for is a re-scoring you
do not do. Record once, replay for free.
