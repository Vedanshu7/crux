"""
Decision recall against a real model.

Marked ``live`` and excluded from CI. These are measurements, not correctness
tests: they move when a prompt changes, which is exactly what they are for.

Run them with a recorded cassette (free, deterministic):

    uv run pytest tests/evals -m live

Or re-record against the real model:

    CRUX_RECORD=1 uv run pytest tests/evals -m live

The ratchets below are floors to raise over time, not targets that were tuned to
whatever the current numbers happen to be. Raise one only after a change that
should have improved it.
