"""
The litellm-backed client.

litellm rather than a provider SDK because a host should be able to point crux at
whatever model they already pay for. Structured output goes through a forced tool
call, which is the more portable of the two mechanisms across providers.

Two things happen here that are easy to get wrong and were measured rather than
guessed. Retries wait as long as the provider asked for, because a free tier's
per-minute budget refills over a minute and a fast retry is a second failure that
also spends what it was waiting for. And a turn that comes back as prose where a
tool call was demanded counts as a *failed attempt*, not a success, because that
is the commonest way a weak model fails and it would otherwise be invisible to the
fallback chain.

    Decide what a provider failure means for the chain.

    An ordered ladder, most specific first, and the order is load-bearing. The
    obvious rules are wrong in ways that were checked against the pinned litellm
    rather than assumed:

    - ``ContextWindowExceededError``, ``ContentPolicyViolationError`` and
      ``UnsupportedParamsError`` are all ``BadRequestError`` subclasses, so a
      plain "bad request means fatal" refuses to fall back on three cases where
      another provider genuinely succeeds. They must be caught first.
    - ``ServiceUnavailableError`` and ``BadGatewayError`` are *not*
      ``InternalServerError`` subclasses, so "retry on 5xx" written as
      ``except InternalServerError`` misses 502 and 503, the two commonest.
      Checking the status code catches them without naming them.
    - ``BudgetExceededError`` descends from bare ``Exception`` and is caught by
      no ``APIError`` clause at all.
    - Groq reports a model's own tool failures as 400s: "Tool choice is
      required, but model did not call a tool", and ``tool_use_failed`` when
      the model's arguments were not valid JSON. Every other provider returns
      the prose or the broken call and lets us judge it. It is the model
      failing, not the request, and a fresh sample usually gets it right, so
      these are retried like a rate limit rather than treated as our own
      malformed schema. Both seen on gpt-oss-20b within the first corpus case.
