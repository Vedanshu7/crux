"""
The reasoner: six typed operations, implemented over a chat client.

Everything that knows about messages, tool calls and JSON lives here and in
:mod:`crux.adapters.llm.prompts`. The application layer above sees only pydantic
in and pydantic out.

Parsing is forgiving in one specific way: a single malformed entry is dropped
with a warning rather than failing the whole batch. A model that gets one of six
decisions wrong should cost one decision, not the session.
