"""
Which model serves which operation.

Two tiers, grouped by what the work actually demands rather than by one knob per
function. Naming what is undecided in a whole-project brief is the hardest thing
crux asks of a model; labelling a one-line reply as one of six kinds is the
easiest. Paying frontier prices for the second is waste, and paying free-tier
prices for the first is measurable: it is what produced 2% edge coherence in the
saturation run.

Pure policy. No I/O, no provider knowledge, no settings import beyond reading a
flat field bag once in :meth:`ModelRouting.of`.
