"""
Turning what a model proposed into decisions the graph will accept.

Two jobs here carry most of the risk in crux.

**Dedup.** A duplicate decision does not merely ask twice; it splits the edges
that should have pointed at one node, so a prune fires against one copy and
misses the other. Exact on canonical ids, token-overlap on freeform.

**Grading.** ``cost_if_wrong`` comes from the proposal's *position* in a ranked
list rather than from a per-item label, because models rank far more reliably
than they score. Where a proposal resembles a pack spec, it inherits that spec's
authored grading instead — an authored value beats a ranked one, and the packs
are the only calibration anchor crux has.
