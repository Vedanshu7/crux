"""
Run traceability: what crux did, what it was told, and what it produced.

A clarification is a chain of judgements, and "why did it ask me that?" is the
question people actually have. The session answers it in principle — it holds the
graph, the transcript and the pass log — but only if someone deserialises it.
This writes the same information out in a form a person can read, alongside the
raw model exchanges that produced it.

Recording is off unless a run asks for it. It writes prompts and retrieved
excerpts to disk, which is exactly what you want when debugging and exactly what
you do not want happening silently.
